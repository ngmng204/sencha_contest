              <text1>The Pavilion cinema was one of the oldest cinemas in Cork City. It opened for business on 10 March 1921. The first film screened was D.W. Griffiths THE GREATEST QUESTION. With 900 seats, the cinema quickly established itself as one of the most popular cinemas in Cork. It was the first cinema in Cork City to be equipped with technology for the new  talking films – films with speech. Its first ‘talkie’ was shown here on 5 August 1929. A fire caused major damage to the cinema in February 1930 but it reopened in June of the same year. The Pavilion Restaurant was also popular with the locals. 

Interesting architectural features include the upper barrel vaulted ceiling with original plaster moldings which is retained in the modern day live music venue much to the thrill of the concert goers! Externally the unusual material which clads the walls and the decorative details enhance the façade of this notable building. 

The Pavilion closed as a cinema in August 1989. The popular music store HMV now occupies the front of the premises on Patrick Street. The old cinema part of the premises was re-opened in the early 90’s as a nightclub and bar on Carey’s Lane. In 2008 new owners gave the cinema a much needed makeover and re-opened it as a live music venue upstairs and late night bar/café downstairs. It hosts an array of live music events and has fast become one of Cork’s great live music venues.

<info>LAKKER (Killekill/Blueprint)
WARREN KNOWLES (Electric Underground)

We've had one half of Lakker at EU before in the form of Eomac, but now we are thrilled to be bringing their amazing AV show to the Pavilion for the first time. We're really excited about this one!
Lakker are an exciting 2-piece from Dublin. Recent releases on James Ruskin's Blueprint Records and Berlin's much respected Killekill label have caught the attention of the likes of Surgeon, Laurent Garnier, Ben Sims, Luke Slater and none other than Aphex Twin.
They have also just recently recorded a mix for Rob Booth's Electronic Explorations.

Find out more here:

EU resident Warren Knowles provides worthy support on the night.

A paltry €5 before 12, and €8 after. This one is definitely not to be missed.

<name>Loefah (Swamp81, Dmz, Planet Mu, Tectonic)</name>
<date>2012-09-21</date>
<time>10:30 pm</time>
<category>DJ / Nightlife</category>
<admission>€10</admission>
<info>Widely regarded as one of the best Djs in the world today and bossman at critically acclaimed label Swamp 81, Loefah makes his Cork debut this September 21st at the Pavilion. 

The seminal work of the producer pioneer, Peter Livingston aka Loefah has been formative in the creation and development of the now worldwide scene of dubstep. Along with his partners, Mala and Coki, he started and continues to run the now infamous DMZ brand. 

His own production was initially well known for his much respected bass weight and half time beat pattern, well illustrated by his productions such as ‘Horror Show’, ‘Mud’ and ‘Ruffage’.

As the dubstep genre, for one reason or another,  grew further and further from its roots, Loefah turned his attention to an emergent new hive of creativity to create the home label, Swamp 81, in 2009. With a steady stream of output from Kryptic minds, Skream, Pinch, Ramadanman, Addison groove, Instra:mental, Boddika and FaultyDL, it became increasingly clear that Swamp81 is dedicated to the promotion of subcultural bass music rather than dubstep music per se. 

The releases display a like minded dedication to weighty electronic music and that is what has made the ripples world wide for this label, winner of the best new label in at the dubstep awards 2010. Reflecting this eclecticism, Swamp81 releases are being supported by a variation of DJs such as A-Trak, Josh Wink, Joy Orbison, Ricardo Villalobos, Giles Peterson, Kode9, Benji B, and many more. Whilst Loefah continues to tour voraciously through clubland, his music increasingly progresses into new territory, pushing the sound of Swamp 81 and the UK’s underground scene in general.

<name>Kan and Deluce’s Patent </name>
<date>2012-10-04</date>
<time>9:00 pm</time>
<category>Live Music</category>
<admission>€20</admission>
<info>Kan is a unique melding of the bold and beautiful flute virtuosity of Brian Finnegan, from Armagh in the North of Ireland, with the expressive and daring fiddle deftness of Aidan O’Rourke, from Scotland’s Isle of Seil, cemented by the organic and intuitive drumming of Harrogate’s James Goodwin and the unfettered, playful guitar reinventions of Ian Stephenson, out of Selby in Yorkshire.





Deluce’s Patent from Counties Kerry and Cork has a unique sound. The Band features Evelyn O’Connell whose voice is lyrical and sweet, and deeply rooted in the Irish tradition; Adrian Spillett whose approach is more contemporary with traces of Americana ; as well as the strong instrumental and backing vocal line of Deirdre Granville (harp) and Conor O’Sullivan (guitar, banjo).</info>

<admission>€15</admission>
<info>Session Americana
No two Session Americana shows are alike. They’re rowdy, freewheeling modern hootenannies that surprise the audience as much as they surprise the Somerville, Massachusetts sextet. Session Americana has innovatively recast the live show experience as a familial gathering of musicians seated at a round table swapping songs and instruments. Although the musicians face each other, the audience feels drawn into the circle, engaged by the joyous camaraderie, playful musicality, and charmingly original music of this all-star cast of characters.

Serge Desaunay &amp; Kieran Fahy
Serge Desaunay is very committed to Quebec and Celtic music and has been for many years. He played with Les Maudzits Français and many other musicians from the world of Quebec music in France. Passionate about the accordion, he multiplies meetings and experiences to go from traditional to swing-musette while working as a composer at the same time.</info>

<name>Martin Carthy and Dave Swarbrick Plus Mick Daly</name>
<date>2012-10-06</date>
<time>9:00 pm</time>
<category>Live Music</category>
<admission>€20</admission>
<info>The super-duo are back together after 14 years. Great guitarist and singer Martin Carthy and virtuoso violin player Dave Swarbrick first became heroes of the British folk scene when they worked as an acoustic duo back in the 1960s, before Swarbrick went off to join the finest lineup of Fairport Convention. They were reunited in the early 90s, but Swarbrick then became so ill that the Daily Telegraph famously published his premature obituary. He has now recovered and, following an emotional reunion with the Fairports earlier this year, here is a new Carthy-Swarbrick album that is every bit as good as their earlier work.

They stick to the old formula, with Carthy singing and playing robust acoustic guitar, and Swarbrick switching between thoughtful accompaniment and rousing solos. Best of all are the fiddle tunes, which serve as a reminder that Dave Swarbrick is also an inspired writer. Welcome back. –Review of ‘Straws in the Wind’ by Robin Denselow.

The concert will feature long time member of the Lee Valley String Band,  

5 string Banjo/guitarist and singer Mick Daly.</info>
